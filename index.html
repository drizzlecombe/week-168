        <h1>CARES Winlink Net: Week 168 Exercise</h1>

        <p>Your teammates' exercise material is below. You should see their
        bridge photograph and their response. Each AUXC who submitted an image
        should have at least one included. 
        
        <p>If you hover over an image and it resizes slightly, this indicates
        that this is not the submitted size. You can click to see the original,
        full-sized image. Use the browser's back button to return to this
        check-in listing page from the full-sized image.</p>

        <p> If latitude and longitude were included, I've linked to a map to
        show where the picture was taken from. The map centres on the provided
        location - so you may have to look for the bridge close by.</p>

        <p>All other simple check-ins have been recorded, so if you do not see
        your check-in sentence - rest assured: I have it and it has been added
        to the roster list for week 168.</p>

        <p> Your exercise requirements this week were to:</p>
        <div class="exercise-requirements">
            <ul>
                <li> Find a bridge which you can SAFELY access or view on foot.</li>
                <li> Conduct a layperson's inspection of the bridge and document it on an ICS-213</li>
                <li> Photograph the bridge, or a detail of the bridge.</li>
                <li> Bundle all this up and send it in a message to CLACKAMAS-WEEKLYNET</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <h2>Individual AUXCs' bridge images and observations</h2>

        <p>Note that if an AUXC checked in through multiple RMSs, then each check-in
            sentence is provided at the top of their information.</p>

            <p>The photo shows the Childs Road bridge over the Lake Oswego
            canal. There has been no obvious erosion surrounding the bridge
            abutments, and transitions between the bridge deck and the roadway
            are smooth and without any cracks that would indicate relative
            movement. Inspection of guardrail attachments to the bridge appear
            solid, with no indications of movement or shifting. The beam
            carrying utilities on the south side of the bridge is intact and
            does not show any signs of damage or displacement.</p>
            
            <p>Photo was taken about 40 feet from the south side of the bridge

            <p>Bridge appears to be in good condition, made of wood on concrete
            footings. This bridge is only 2 feet off the ground so no protection
            handrails are present, but there is a "felloe guard" (old wagon term
            "hub of a wagon wheel) used to prevent wheels from going off the
            edge, although the "felloe guard" (curb) was used to protect the
            wagons felloe from damage from rubbing the side of the bridge.</p>
            
            <p>The Hydro inspector, Bailey, was there at the time and was
            disappointed that the water had gone down. Although we were promised
            good weather, the fog had not yet lifted and it was 43 degrees.</p>

            <p> Sellwood Bridge crosses the Willamette River between Highway 43
            and Sellwood. Sellwood Bridge meets Tacoma Avenue at 5th Ave SE.</p>

            <p> The photo attached was taken facing west from the footpath
            directly under the bridge on the east bank of the Willamette river
            at: <a href="https://osm.org/go/WIDkYt866--"><strong>45.4642,
            -122.6632</strong></a>. The image was captured on Thursday
            20260115T1158.</p>


            <p> Generally, the bridge is in good condition. The decking is not
            distorted and there is no visible cracking in any of the concrete
            components. The steelwork and pylons are also in good condition. The
            guardrails and lampposts are all in good, serviceable condition and
            the roadway is sufficiently marked to divide traffic as
            expected.</p>

            <p> The interface between the bridge deck and the access roads are
            in good condition. All expansion joints look normal.</p>

            <p> The bridge anchors show no signs of wear.</p>
            
            <p>The photograph shows the underside of the deck. The steelwork
            appears to be rusty - but intentionally so. There are no missing
            rivets nor bolts. There are small, filled holes in the bottom of the
            concrete decking.</p>
